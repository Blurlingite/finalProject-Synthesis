    <!-- define a container that will contain the entire form using the class = "container" (pre-defined by bootstrap) -->

    <div class = "container">
      <h2><p class = "contactW"> Contact Us</p></h2>

       <!-- specify a horizontal form and use "action" to tell it where (which file) to send the data after subnmitting -->

      <form class = "form-horizontal" action = "h.html">

<!-- For each pair of label and text box:
  1) Give a div with the class = "form-group" to envelop the first line of a form 

  2) Give the label a class ="control-label" and a column specification (in this case we want it to take up 2 out of 12 columns so col-sm-2 (the sm means it will change when the screen size is small, see more info on w3schools) and a for = "xxxx" to specify which element the label belongs to (in this case it is for ="name" since this field will be accepting a Name) Finally, put the text for the label name (Name:) and close the label tag)

  3) Now define how many columns the text box will take up by putting it in a div class(in this case we want 10 out of 12 columns so we would do this:
  div class= "col-sm-10")

  4) Now time to actually display the text box using an input type. 

  a) Give it the class called form-control:
  class = "form-control") 

  b)  Then give it a type. The input type should match the for="xxxx" you gave to the label (in this case it would be "name" 

  c) Then give it an id that matches the label's for (in this case, it is "name"

  d) Now, give it a name that matchs the label''s for (in this case it is "name") 

  e) Finally give it a placeholder that will display a hint in the message box of what the user should enter here, or not if you don't want one here.

5) make sure you end all the divs you made and they line up with their starting divs. 

6) Repeat steps 1-5 for each text field on the form.

        <div class = "form-group">
          <label class = "control-label col-sm-2 textW" for "name">Name: </label>

          <input class = "form-control" type = "name"  id = "name" name = "name" placeholder = "Enter name">

          <div class = "col-sm-10">
            <input class = "form-control"type = "email" id  "email" name = "email" placeholder = "Enter email">

<!-- How to make a dropdown menu within the form

7) make a div with the class "dropdown"

8) Make the label (see step 2 in above comments)

9) Make the button

a)  give it the class "btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" to allow you to open a dropdown menu after clicking

b) give it a type = "button" because it is a button you will click to do something

c) give it the data-toggle = "dropdown" to allow the dropdown effect to apply to this class of "dropdown" (as shown by div class = "dropdown")

d) Give it a name or don't. DO NOT close the button tag yet.

e) give a span class = "caret" (you may be able to replace "span" with "p" or something) The .caret class creates the arrow that activates the dropdown. NOW you may close the button tag

f) To actually build the dropdown menu use an unordered list (ul) with the class of "dropdown-menu" Populate the list with the choices you want. You can also insert links: right before the choice name open up an <a href = "insert url/file path here" and end the tag before the ending "li" tag. See this link on how to do this: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_dropdown-menu&stacked=h

g) you can add the column amount after the classes of the "button" and "ul" to adjust the size pf the dropdown menu

Also, I added my own column specifications within the class -->
